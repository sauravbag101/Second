            By signing the Inflation Reduction Act,<i><b> President Biden</b></i> is delivering on his promise to build an economy that works for working families, including <i>Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (AA and NHPI) families.</i> The Inflation Reduction Act lowers prescription drug costs, health care costs, and energy costs. It's the most aggressive action we have taken to confront the climate crisis. It'll lower the deficit and ask the super wealthy and corporations to pay their fair share. And no one making under $400,000 per year will pay a penny more in taxes.

            Lower Prescription Drug Costs for Seniors: Americans pay 2-3 times more for their prescription drugs than people in other wealthy countries. Nearly 1 in 4 Americans struggle to afford prescription drugs, and high prices contribute to racial and ethnic health inequities. The Inflation Reduction Act will help close the gap in access to medication by improving prescription drug coverage and <span className='text-blue-600'>lowering drug prices in Medicare.

           <span className='text-blue-600'> President Trump and Congressional Republicans' 2017</span> tax law only made an unfair tax system worse. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 is a critical step forward in making our tax code fairer. It will raise revenue by:

            The legislation's tax reforms won't just raise revenue to finance critically needed investments to lower costs and combat climate change, they are also an important component of building an economy that rewards work rather than wealth and doesn't let the rich and powerful get away with playing by a separate set of rules.

            Millions of working families will have better access to the benefits they are entitled to under the tax code and be able to get their questions answered quickly and efficiently, thanks to the Act's transformational investments in the Internal Revenue Service. And, no family making less than $400,000 per year will see their taxes go up by a single cent.
